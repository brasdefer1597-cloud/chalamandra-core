Subject: RE: Project Timeline

Hi John,

I'm absolutely THRILLED with the new project timeline you've proposed. 

Nothing makes me happier than seeing deadlines moved up by two weeks right after we've already committed to client deliverables. This is exactly what we needed!

I'm sure the team will be just as excited to work through the weekend to make this happen. After all, who needs personal time when we have such inspiring leadership?

Can't wait to see how this plays out! 

"Looking forward" to our next update,
Emily
