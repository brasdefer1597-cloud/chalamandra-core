# ‚ùì FAQ for Hackathon Judges

## TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### Q: How does the sarcasm detection work?
**A**: We use a multi-layered approach:
1. Text pattern analysis (excessive positivity, contradictions)
2. Visual context analysis (emoji/text incongruence) 
3. Cross-modal attention (text + image relationship analysis)
4. Chrome AI APIs for contextual understanding

### Q: What makes your hybrid architecture special?
**A**: Three key innovations:
1. **Privacy by default** - 100% local processing first
2. **Intelligent fallbacks** - 4-layer robustness system
3. **Consent-based enhancement** - Server only with explicit user permission

### Q: How do you handle different communication platforms?
**A**: Platform-aware analysis:
- Email: Formal tone, professional context
- LinkedIn: Semi-formal, networking focus  
- Slack: Informal, quick collaboration
- Adaptive analysis based on platform norms

## BUSINESS QUESTIONS

### Q: What's your target market?
**A**: Primary: Business professionals (44% email misinterpretation)
Secondary: Teams and organizations ($12,000/employee annual cost)

### Q: How is this different from grammar checkers?
**A**: We analyze communication intelligence, not grammar:
- Grammar: "Is this sentence correct?"
- Chalamandra: "Will this message be misunderstood?"

### Q: What's your privacy approach?
**A**: Privacy-first architecture:
- No data collection by default
- Local processing only unless explicit consent
- Anonymous metadata for optional enhancement
- No tracking or analytics

## IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS

### Q: How do you ensure accuracy?
**A**: Multi-dimensional validation:
1. Pattern-based heuristics
2. Chrome AI API analysis
3. Contextual understanding
4. Explainable AI for transparency

### Q: What happens when Chrome AI APIs aren't available?
**A**: Robust fallback system:
1. Chrome AI APIs (primary)
2. TensorFlow.js models (secondary) 
3. Pattern-based analysis (tertiary)
4. Basic heuristics (final)

### Q: How scalable is your solution?
**A**: Designed for scale:
- Local processing handles individual users
- Hybrid architecture supports organizational use
- Privacy-first design enables enterprise adoption
